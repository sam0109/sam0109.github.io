Hello there, I'm writing this blog to keep friends, family, and any strangers who stumble upon this series of posts up-to-date on my van progress!

# The Man
When I was 9 I built a wooden box for my scooter, packed it with food, water, a jacket, blankets, and utensils and told my mom that I was going on an adventure to the park to have lunch. This was likely the first indication that I was going to grow up to be a van dweller, but nobody saw the signs in time and so here we are. For the past year I’ve been considering this endeavour and planning various ways to go about it, and just recently everything has culminated into means, motive, and opportunity.

# The Plan
In order to have a fighting chance to complete a non-trivial construction project while living in an apartment building I have put considerable time and thought into logistics. This time and thought has culminated in what I call “The Plan.”

### The Location
After being persuaded by my far-too-grounded girlfriend that constructing the van in the parking lot of HomeDepot over the course of several months was not likely to work, I reached out to a local [makerspace](https://www.makerspace.nyc/) who agreed to let me use their loading dock and woodshop to build the van.

### The Storage
Sadly, the Makerspace doesn’t offer long term parking, so I’ve had to explore other avenues. After watching for a few weeks, I believe that my street offers adequate parking. If that proves to be untenable, then I’ll have to shell out for a proper parking space in a garage.

### The Materials
I’ve discovered that there is a HomeDepot and a Lowes a mile from my apartment, from which I plan to source most of my materials. Moving materials to and from The Location should be simple, considering I have a commercial van at my disposal.

# The Van
Here’s the fun part.

I plan to do my build in a [Dodge Ram ProMaster 2500 High Roof 159” WB](https://www.jdpower.com/cars/2020/ram-truck/promaster-cargo/2500-high-roof-159%22-wb). This van seems to offer the best of size, overall height vs internal height, initial and ongoing costs, and community support. The ProMaster forums are a wellspring of knowledgeable, do-it-yourself hippies and I have seen numerous build outs of the van to help me know what to expect during my own build out.

The Van will feature:
- Heater
- Microwave
- Oven
- Stove
- Refrigerator
- Convertible bed / bench / table
- Shower
- Hot Water
- Toilet
- Puck Lighting
- Outlets

As for materials, I have spent the last week compiling a meticulous [bill of materials](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cVYdeulkEIWeeOYqKTBw-owg04e7UsxCpph8GKZzkRs/edit?usp=sharing) for The Van, cataloguing all materials save for electrical and plumbing fittings which will have to be done on the spot.

With regards to the overall design, I decided to go for a dual electric / propane system in order to gain the utility of having electricity in the van for the purposes of charging devices, powering wifi, lighting, etc. while also gaining the energy-density and availability of propane to do the heavy lifting of cooking and heating.

The solar system is powered by 3 100w Renogy panels, charging one 200Ah AGM battery which is also hooked up to the alternator for passive charging while driving. The output of the system will be some 12v lines for the LEDs, water pump, and the refrigerator, and some 120v lines for the outlets and microwave.

The full design is captured in a CAD model [linked here](https://autode.sk/3bFI3RU) (be sure to hide various elements to see the innards!)

And that’s about the gist of it! I’ll update with another post once I’ve taken the dive and actually purchased the van.
